# Longest-Common-Subsequence-LCS
The LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the longest subsequence that is common to two or more sequences. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
